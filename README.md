OOP Project VNU-HCMUS 2022

## üí´ About

This is the final project for the Object-Oriented Programming course in the Data Science program, class of 2020. The task involves dealing with a list of geometric objects, including circles, ellipses, crescent shapes, convex polygons, rectangles, squares, and triangles. Given a straight line (ax + by = c) in the plane, the function determines which shapes from the list it intersects. The application allows the creation of shapes and a straight line, drawing these elements, indicating how many shapes the line intersects, and coloring the intersected shapes differently.

## Technologies Used

## Collaborators

I worked collaboratively with ƒê·∫∑ng Y·∫øn Linh, who handled the mathematical part of determining intersected shapes. I express my gratitude to those who guided and supported us in achieving this success. Special thanks to the highly appreciated instructors.
